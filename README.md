# POPS Internship - Data Analyst & Data Consulting

## Tools used and mastered

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter-notebook)

- Dash Plotly - dasboard python extension

- AWS API

- MapBox API

## Work
- The most fundamental task of my internship was the crunching and parsing of raw sales data, in order to be able to extract clean and easily interpretable data.

- I set up algorithms which calculate key metrics from the customer database (repeat rate for example)

- I set up machine learning algorithms in order to determine the most interesting characteristics and customer profiles to target customers who buy several times using the key metrics (random forest learning was the most conclusive)

- I completed a customisable dashboard for data-visualisation, coded in Python/Dash useful for consulting and for the marketing team: (click on the picture to have an exemple of dashboard provided by Dash, I cannot provide the Pops dashboard here due to privacy concerns)

## My internship at Pops

[POPS](https://pops.co/) is a start-up in the field of photography. It is an online photo printing service. The added value of POPS is to be able to print photos in a quite innovative lenticular format, with a 3D effect.

As Data Analyst Intern, I analysed customer data from gross sales data. I worked with all teams, as all the data I processed was relevant to all teams. I retrieved precise data by working with the back department, I analysed this data with a few members of the back team, including a Computer Vision - Machine Learning engineer who had a _MVA Master's degree at ENS Paris Saclay_, one of the most recognised Master in the world in this field.

I had the opportunity to advise the front-design and artistic department to give them feedback on the sales of their products, on the opinion of the users, their satisfaction by a key indicator: the repeat rate. This last indicator, one of the most important in web marketing, measures the rate of buyers who buy back a product they have already bought. At first glance, this is a fairly simple parameter to calculate, but in practice, it is quite complicated to calculate this indicator cleanly and accurately.

This task was one of the most formative during my internship. I performed a very interesting and complete Data Science task, both in terms of reflection and implementation in an efficient and effective Python code. Thanks to this task I developed new skills in Data Science and in code with Python, I even had the opportunity to create a complete dashboard in the Dash language, a python extension (see picture above).
