# Pops Internship - Data Analyst Intern & Data Consul1ng

POPS is a start-up in the field of photography. It is an online photo printing service. The added value of POPS is to be able to print photos in a quite innovative lenticular format, with a 3D effect.

As Data Analyst Intern, I analysed customer data from gross sales data. I worked with all teams, as all the data I processed was relevant to all teams. I retrieved precise data by working with the Back department, I analysed this data with a few members of the Back team, including a Computer Vision - Machine Learning - Data Scientist engineer who had a MVA Master's degree at ENS Paris Saclay, one of the most prestigious diplomas in the world in this field.

I had the opportunity to advise the front-design and artistic department to give them feedback on the sales of their products, on the opinion of the users, their satisfaction by a key indicator: the repeat rate. This last indicator, one of the most important in web marketing, measures the rate of buyers who buy back a product they have already bought. At first glance, this is a fairly simple parameter to calculate, but in practice, it is quite complicated to calculate this indicator cleanly and accurately.

Following these analyses, I was therefore able to determine the best performing products according to this indicator (with the highest repeat rate) and the least performing ones according to time. One of the subtleties of the analysis was the possibility of varying the time scale. One of the classic analysis set up with the repeat rate is this indicator: it is possible to know the % of buyers among those who bought in a given month, having bought less than 30 days later.

This task was one of the most formative during my internship. I performed a very interesting and complete Data Science task, both in terms of reflection and implementation in an efficient and effective Python code. Thanks to this task I developed new skills in Data Science and in code with Python, I even had the opportunity to create a complete dashboard in the Dash language (python extension), here is the result:
